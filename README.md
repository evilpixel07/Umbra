> ## An encrypted notes sharing platform

Umbra is secure notes sharing platform , where users can create a note with a title and tags with rich text options. User can secure each note content by a password , without which no one is allowed to see it. Sharing is also possible with permissions (read or read+write) with the help of email.

**The most important things is , each and every note content is stored in encrypted form in database. Server never sees the raw content.** 
All encryption and decryption happens on the client side using the password created by the owner.
